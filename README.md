## Installation:
To sucessfully run the code presented withinin this repository, it is required to install several libraries. Instal matplotlib for plotting using: $ pip install identifiability and for curve and paraterfitting install: 
$ pip install matplotlib). For numerical computations numpy is requierd and can be installed using: $ pip install numpy.  scipy for optimization and scientific functions (pip install scipy), pandas for data manipulation (pip install pandas), and lmfit for advanced curve fitting (pip install lmfit). The modules os and copy are part of Python’s standard library and do not require installation. For the identifiability module (which includes conf_interval), install it with pip install identifiability or follow the specific instructions provided in this repository if it’s a custom module. To simplify the setup process, use the included requirements.txt file by running pip install -r requirements.txt. Ensure you are using Python 3.8 or higher. If you plan to run the code in a Jupyter Notebook, you can install it with pip install notebook. Following these steps will set up your environment and prepare you to execute the code smoothly.
